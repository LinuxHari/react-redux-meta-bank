# Meta-Bank

It is an application in which users can deposit,withdraw and view history of actions done by user.

## Front-End

I have used `Redux Toolkit` for state management.  

`React-router` is used for routing between pages without sending request to front-end.  

`Axios` is used for sending HTTP requests and better error management.  

`React-hook-form` is used for managing,validating and submitting data.  

`CreateAsyncThunk` is used as it simplifies the process of defining and dispatching asynchronous actions.  

`LocalStorage` is used for storing and retrieving data./

## Back-End

`Express.js` is used for handling routing,middlewares and HTTP requests.  

`Session` is used for user authentication.  

`Cookie-Parser` is used with session for storing session details as cookies.  

`Mongoose` is used to provide structure to mongoDB documents.
